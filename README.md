# My dotfiles

I've created this repository to keep track of my dotfiles and just share them,
hoping they'll be useful. I've got no plan to write any detailed instructions
since this is a very simple repo, but if I anytime decide to add more
configurations and make it richer, I will take care of an installation script
and general instructions on how you can customise it.

You could see my personal settings (no worries, there's nothing confidential)
to see how you can make yours, so be very careful if you're planning to test my
dotfiles. In some configurations you'll see my PGP Key IDs, domains, usernames,
or commands like `pass pass-name` where I am getting a password - I recommend
you do the same and never use plain text passwords in a configuration file as
far as possible. Anyhow, if I decide to add an installation script someday, I
will remove them so by calling the script you'll be able to generate your own
settings.
